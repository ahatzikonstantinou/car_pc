These are several versions of graphics used as homescreen wallpaper with my Nexus 7 (2012). The inkscape settings are page size 1280x702 px (landscape), export custom x:0 y:-63 x1:1280 y1:737 width:1280 height:800 to get an image size of width:1280 height:800 at 90 dpi
Widgets were created with UCCW and when placed on screen, were resized to fit their corresponding places. While determining their positions best set their transparency in UCCW to 50%, and wehn final set it to 0%. Note: use a tasker widget for TabletTalk phone because despite choosing app phone for UCCW widget hotspot the app launched is TabletTalk and not phone.
